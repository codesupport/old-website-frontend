## Setup

2. Start the React app with `npm start`
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

**Want an easier setup?** Pull down our [website development environment](https://github.com/codesupport/website-dev-env) and quickly start working.

## Structure
We're using [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) to keep our folders organised. There are three main folders:
- Our tests live inside `__tests__/`
- Our components live inside `components/`
- Our services live inside `services/`
- Our styling lives inside `css/`

Please name files (which aren't components) with their type in, for example `GitHubService` or `UserProfileServiceTest`. This helps make the file names more readable in your editor.

## Tests
We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for our tests. Any code that manipulates the state or fetches data from an API **must** be tested.

## Commands
- To start the React app use `npm start`
- To test the React app use `npm test`
    - Use `npm test -- --coverage` to get a coverage report
